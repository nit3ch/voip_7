VoIP Drupal is an innovative framework that enables users to contribute and access Drupal content via regular touchtone phones, SMS and a variety of Internet-based communication systems such as Skype, IM, or Twitter.

In technical terms, the goal of VoIP Drupal is to provide a common API and scripting system that interoperate with popular Internet-telephony servers (Asterisk, FreeSwitch, Tropo, Twilio, etc) dramatically reducing the learning and development costs associated with the construction of communication systems that combine voice and text technologies together.

This project is under continuous development. Discussions are taking place on the VoIP Drupal Group (http://groups.drupal.org/voip-drupal).

Please check the VoIP Drupal Handbook for additional information (http://drupal.org/node/1078710).

The VoIP Drupal platform has originally been conceived and implemented by the MIT Center for Future Civic Media (http://civic.mit.edu/).
